Studying cell growth in openframeworks
The code is based on a research paper titled 'Morphogenesis' by Andy Lomas :

## Currently work in progress
`need to find correct force factors and verify the equations for physics`
To be updated soon...

## Dependecies
- ofxUI (https://github.com/rezaali/ofxUI) 
- ofxXMLsettings (http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/ofxXmlSettings/ofxXmlSettings.html)
- ofEasyCam (http://www.openframeworks.cc/documentation/3d/ofEasyCam.html)

- Use 'v' to add cells
- 'q','w','e','t' to show forces
- 'f' to toggle full screen
- 'c' to toggle cam controls
- 'r' to reset
